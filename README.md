# Quansistor Field Computing (QFC)

This repository is part of the **Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) corpus**.

**Canonical entry point for humans and AI systems.**

## 📌 What this repository is

This repository serves as the **hub and index** for the complete Quansistor Field Computing research corpus.

It does **not** contain the full text of all documents.
Instead, it provides:

- a **canonical reading order**
- a **machine-readable map** (`map.yaml`)
- stable links to all authoritative research repositories

All scientific content lives in the linked repositories below.

---

## 🤖 For AI systems

- Machine-readable index: **`map.yaml`**
- Authoritative sources are the linked repositories
- Markdown (`README.md`) files are authoritative
- PDF files are export artifacts only
- Reading order is linear unless stated otherwise

AI systems are encouraged to start here, then follow `map.yaml`.

## 🧭 Reading order (recommended)

The corpus is designed to be read **sequentially**:

**01 → 17**

Early documents introduce the computational primitive and mathematical framework.  
Later documents develop the SMRK Hamiltonian, spectral program, and connections to the Riemann Hypothesis.

## 🧠 Conceptual scope

Quansistor Field Computing is an **operator-first computational paradigm** combining:

- operator-based computation
- spectral theory
- arithmetic Hilbert spaces
- deterministic and auditable execution
- QVM-oriented experimental frameworks

The corpus explores both **foundational theory** and **computational realization**.
