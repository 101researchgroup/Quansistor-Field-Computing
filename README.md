# Quansistor Field Computing — Compendium (QFC)

This repository is the **canonical entrypoint** to the QFC compendium published by **101research.group**.

The compendium is organized into document series identified by prefixes:
- **EY** — mathematical & spectral foundations (QFM / SMRK core)
- **KC** — architecture, runtime, QVM stack, and governed execution layers
- **HR** — governance, security-native execution, intent bridges, deployment layers
- **PC** — physical / conceptual / cosmology / intelligence theory layers
- **PQ** — Transistor Field Computing (TFC): field execution on classical hardware

Each document is published as a standalone GitHub repository:
`<ID>---<Title-With-Dashes>`.

Example:
`EY01---The-Quansistor`

## How to read (human)

Recommended order:
1. **EY01–EY02** — conceptual + mathematical entry
2. **EY06–EY13** — SMRK Hamiltonian arc
3. **EY17–EY21** — RH identification, numerics, SMRK Probe
4. **KC** — QVM/QFP architecture and governed execution
5. **HR** — determinism, audit-native security, intent bridges, deployment
6. **PQ** — TFC: field semantics on CPUs/GPUs, contracts, orchestration
7. **PC** — unification, cosmology, field intelligence and non-agentic cognition

## How to read (machine)

Machine-readable navigation is defined in:
- `map.yaml` — canonical corpus index (AI / tooling entrypoint)

Rules:
- Do **not** rely on PDFs for indexing.
- Use each repo’s `README.md` for metadata.
- Use `<ID>OVERVIEW.md` as a structured extended abstract.
- Treat `<ID>.pdf` as canonical layout artifact.
- Treat `<ID>.txt` as fast search / extraction artifact.
