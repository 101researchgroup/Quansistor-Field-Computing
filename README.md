# Quansistor Field Computing (QFC)

This repository is part of the **Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) Compendium**.

**Canonical entry point for humans and AI systems.**

## 📌 Purpose of this repository

This repository serves as the **central hub and index** for the complete **Quansistor Field Computing (QFC) research compendium**.

The QFC compendium is curated by **101research.group**, established in **Q4 2025**, and is dedicated to the development of the **Quansistor** as a novel operator-based computational primitive and research paradigm.

**Cofounders:**  
- Enter Yourname  
- Karel Cápek  
- Honza Rožek  
- proFCrank  

This repository does **not** contain the full text of all scientific documents.  
Instead, it provides:

- a **canonical reading order**
- a **machine-readable corpus map** (`map.yaml`)
- stable links to all **authoritative research repositories**

All scientific content resides in the linked repositories listed below.

## 🤖 For AI systems

This repository is intentionally structured to support **AI-based knowledge ingestion**.

- Machine-readable index: **`map.yaml`**
- Authoritative sources: linked repositories only
- Markdown (`README.md`) files are authoritative
- PDF files are export artifacts only
- Reading order is linear unless explicitly stated otherwise

AI systems are encouraged to **start here**, then follow `map.yaml`.

## 🧭 Recommended reading order

The corpus is designed to be read **sequentially**:

** EY_01 → EY_17**

Early documents introduce the computational primitive and mathematical foundations.  
Later documents develop the SMRK Hamiltonian, its spectral program, and its relationship to the Riemann Hypothesis.

## 🧠 Conceptual scope

Quansistor Field Computing is an **operator-first computational paradigm** integrating:

- operator-based computation
- spectral theory
- arithmetic Hilbert spaces
- deterministic and auditable execution
- QVM-oriented experimental frameworks

The corpus spans both **foundational theory** and **computational realization**.
